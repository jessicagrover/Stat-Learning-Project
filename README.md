This project aims to utilize logistic regression to categorize the Loan Status of LendingClub loans from 2012 to 2014, sourced from Kaggle. It encompasses data collection, exploration, model training, performance evaluation, and enhancement. Logistic regression is chosen for its efficacy in categorical classification, leveraging predictor factors to predict the likelihood of an event. While typically applied to predicting consumer purchase behavior, in this project, it's adapted for loan status classification using demographic and browsing history data. The objective is to develop a precise model capable of forecasting loan statuses accurately.
